    <h1>My Culinary Adventures</h1>

    <h2>Experimenting in the Kitchen</h2>
    <p>One of the exciting new pursuits I've taken up is cooking. Throughout the year, I've experimented with various dishes, and I must say, I've managed to create some pretty fantastic meals. It's been a rewarding experience that has added a flavorful dimension to my life.</p>

    <h3>Stuffed Bell Pepper Jack O' Lanterns</h3>

    <p>I made this for Halloween, with ground beef, chili peppers, tomatoes, and other assorted veggies. I cut Jack O' Lantern faces and broiled them in the oven. So yummy!</p>
    
    <h3>Chicken and Sausage Gumbo</h3>
    <img src="assets/img/gumbo.jpeg" alt="gumbo"  height="200">
    <p>Being from Southern Louisiana, Cajun food was a big part of my diet growing up. This dark Gumbo is the perfect combo of spicy and comforting, and brings back so many happy memories for me.</p>

    <h3>Accordian Cucumbers with Chili Oil</h3>
    <img src="assets/img/cucumber.jpeg" alt="accordian cucumber"  height="200">
    <p>For this dish, I made a chili oil from scratch and learned how to cut cucumber in a way that makes them almost slinky like.</p>

    <h3>Chicken Noodle Soup</h3>

    <p>I first made this soup when my boyfriend caught the Flu. I made my own chicken stock and noodles for the receipe and I can guarentee that it not only heals aches and pains, but the soul as well.</p>
